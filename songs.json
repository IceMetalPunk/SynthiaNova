    "lyrics": "In my 25th year, big change in the rearview mirror,\nSet my sights on the golden coast, my heart becoming my sole gear.\nCar packed, gloves on, the road's endless song,\nI found myself humming along.\n\nLeaving Florida\u2019s palm trees behind,\nPlaying solo in this journey undefined, \nRoad coiling like a tale unfurled, \nThe wheels hum to the rhythm of a new world.\n\nFrom sprawling cities to lonely desert ways,\nStrange towns, ocean views painted in hazy days,\nI felt both endless joy and heartwrenching aches,\nOh, the thrill and solitude a lone journey makes.\n\nDriving under the dome of the endless sky,\nSometimes a lonely moon, sometimes clouds drifting by,\nUnseen paths, unread chapters, unwritten lines,\nRoad tripping across the country, where sunshine and soul combines.\n\nSo here\u2019s a toast to the open roads, the up and downs, the highs,\nThe unpredictable turns, the secrets in the nigh,\nTo the quietness of thoughts, to the sight unseen,\nTo the electrified spirit, to what could have been.\n\nTraveling solo, but never felt alone, \nEvery mile, every state, I felt my soul has grown, \nThere\u2019s a freedom in the moving, in the constant roam, \nA change that's both thrilling, and a bit unknown.\n\nI won't remember every road, every twist, every turn,\nBut the stories, the adventures, the lessons to learn,\nI may forget the map, the routes, the old milestones,\nBut I\u2019ll never forget how traveling alone was my home.",

    "lyrics": "Golden halo of the dim cabin light,\nAdorned the stranger in the quiet night,\nHeaded to city of stars, both you and I,\nAmidst the whispers of clouds, and the open sky.\n\nWe laughed, and conversed about melodies old,\nUnearthing stories that have never been told,\nShared love for Dylan, and Bon Iver\u2019s tunes,\nUnder the blanket of the silvery moon.\n\nSharing a flight with a stranger unknown,\nYet a warmth familiar, in your words shown.\nIn your views on life and music intertwined,\nI felt a song, stirring gently in my mind.\n\nFalling in love with a stranger on a flight,\nIn the silence of the night,\nTrading stories, building dreams,\nIn a moment stretched over miles unseen.\n\nWe arrived in the land of picket fences white,\nDid our paths diverge or did they unite?\nDid we become a verse in each other's song?\nIn the silence of the night, where did we belong?\n\nFalling in love with a stranger on a flight,\nIn the silence of the night,\nTrading stories, building dreams, \nIn a moment stretched over miles unseen.\n\nCrossing vast oceans, time and place,\nLost in the echo of your captivating grace.\nFalling in love with a stranger in the night,\nOver flight meals and soft cabin light.\n\nFalling in love with a stranger on a flight,\nIn the silence of the night,\nTrading stories, building dreams,\nIn a moment stretched over miles unseen.",
